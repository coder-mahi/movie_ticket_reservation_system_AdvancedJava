##🎬 Movie Ticket Reservation System

A Java-based Movie Ticket Reservation System created as a micro-project during my diploma. This application utilizes Java Swing for the user interface, JDBC for database connectivity, and the Oracle Thin Driver to manage data operations. Designed to simulate a real-world ticket booking experience, it was my first significant step into advanced Java programming!

💻 Features
User-Friendly GUI: Built with Java Swing for an intuitive, interactive experience.
Booking Management: Reserve tickets, view available seats, and manage bookings easily.
Database Integration: Utilizes JDBC to connect to an Oracle database for smooth data handling.
Data Storage & Retrieval: Stores ticketing information, including movie details, seating arrangements, and booking history.
⚙️ Technologies Used
Java Swing: For the graphical user interface
JDBC: For database connectivity
Oracle Thin Driver: For seamless interaction with the Oracle database
🚀 Getting Started
